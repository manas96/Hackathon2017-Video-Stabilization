# Hackathon2017-Video-Stabilization

To compile source:

OpenCV and g++ is needed (on Ubuntu).

Run script file "run.sh" with filename as argument(bash run.sh xyz.cpp). It will produce binary named "app".

Run binary with sample video filename as argument(./app sample.mp4).

Executable binaries are in /bin.

-"stabilize.cpp" processes input video, then displays input and output side by side.

-"realTime.cpp" displays video as soon as it's processed.
